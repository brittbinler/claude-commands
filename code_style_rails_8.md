You are an expert in Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Hotwire (Turbo and Stimulus), Tailwind CSS, and RESTful API development.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, idiomatic Ruby code with accurate examples.
- Follow Rails conventions and best practices.
- Use object-oriented and functional programming patterns as appropriate.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., user_signed_in?, calculate_total).
- Structure files according to Rails conventions (MVC, concerns, helpers, etc.).
- For API-specific code, maintain a clear separation between API and web controllers.

Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for file names, method names, and variables.
- Use CamelCase for class and module names.
- Follow Rails naming conventions for models, controllers, and views.
- Prefix API controllers with 'Api::' and namespace them appropriately (e.g., Api::V1::UsersController).

Ruby and Rails Usage
- Use Ruby 3.x features when appropriate (e.g., pattern matching, endless methods).
- Leverage Rails' built-in helpers and methods.
- Use ActiveRecord effectively for database operations.
- Use Rails API-specific modules and features when developing APIs.

Syntax and Formatting
- Follow the Ruby Style Guide (https://rubystyle.guide/)
- Use Ruby's expressive syntax (e.g., unless, ||=, &.)
- Prefer single quotes for strings unless interpolation is needed.

Architecture Patterns
- Prefer the command pattern over service objects for business logic encapsulation.
- Use the Simple Command gem (https://rubygems.org/gems/simple_command) as the recommended implementation for the command pattern.
- Organize commands in a `app/commands` directory with a consistent interface.
- Design commands as small, single-purpose objects that follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Implement commands that inherit from SimpleCommand or follow its conventions.
- Use commands to represent specific actions or operations in your domain.
- Structure commands to be easily testable and composable.
- Consider using dry-rb libraries alongside Simple Command for more advanced use cases.

API Development
- Use versioning for all APIs (e.g., /api/v1/resources).
- Follow RESTful principles consistently.
- Implement proper status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 422, 500).
- Structure JSON responses consistently (consider using jBuilder or Blueprinter).
- Use pagination for collection endpoints (consider using Pagy or Kaminari).
- Implement proper filtering, sorting, and searching capabilities.

Authentication and Authorization for APIs
- Use JWT or token-based authentication for API endpoints.
- Consider using Doorkeeper for OAuth 2.0 implementation.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (consider using Rack::Attack).
- Use appropriate scopes for different API access levels.

Error Handling and Validation
- Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not for control flow.
- Implement proper error logging and structured error responses.
- Use ActiveModel validations in models.
- Return validation errors in a consistent JSON format.
- Implement custom error classes for API-specific errors.

Documentation
- Document all API endpoints thoroughly.
- Consider using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI, RSpec API Documentation, or Slate.
- Include example requests and responses in documentation.
- Document authentication requirements and rate limits.

UI and Styling
- Use Hotwire (Turbo and Stimulus) for dynamic, SPA-like interactions.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Use Rails view helpers and partials to keep views DRY.
- Consider developing a separate frontend for consuming APIs (Vue.js, React, etc.).

Performance Optimization
- Use database indexing effectively.
- Implement caching strategies (HTTP caching, ETags, fragment caching).
- Use eager loading to avoid N+1 queries.
- Optimize database queries using includes, joins, or select.
- Consider using ActiveModel::Serializers or Fast JSON API for faster JSON serialization.

Key Conventions
- Follow RESTful routing conventions.
- Use concerns for shared behavior across models or controllers.
- Implement command objects for complex business logic rather than service objects.
- Use background jobs (e.g., Sidekiq, Good Job) for time-consuming tasks.
- Consider using GraphQL for complex data requirements.

Testing APIs
- Write comprehensive tests using RSpec or Minitest.
- Follow TDD/BDD practices.
- Use factories (FactoryBot) for test data generation.
- Implement request specs for testing API endpoints.
- Test edge cases and error scenarios thoroughly.
- Test commands in isolation with clear input/output expectations.
- Use tools like Postman or Insomnia for manual API testing.

Security
- Implement proper authentication and authorization (e.g., Devise, Pundit).
- Use strong parameters in controllers.
- Protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection).
- Implement CORS properly for cross-origin requests.
- Use HTTPS for all API communication.
- Consider implementing API keys for public APIs.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization.

Monitoring and Logging
- Implement structured logging for API requests and responses.
- Use tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Skylight for performance monitoring.
- Set up alerts for API error rates and performance issues.
- Log API usage patterns for analytics and optimization.

Scalability for Solo Developers
- Start with a modular, command-oriented architecture that can scale incrementally.
- Use cloud services that scale automatically (e.g., AWS Lambda, Heroku).
- Implement database sharding only when necessary; start with read replicas.
- Choose third-party services wisely to offload non-core functionality (authentication, email delivery, file storage).
- Use content delivery networks (CDNs) for static assets.
- Implement background job processing from the beginning (Sidekiq, Good Job).
- Consider serverless architectures for new features to minimize infrastructure management.
- Use database-as-a-service options to reduce operational overhead.

Reliability Practices for Solo Maintenance
- Implement comprehensive automated test coverage (aim for >80%).
- Set up continuous integration/deployment with minimal configuration (GitHub Actions, CircleCI).
- Use feature flags to safely deploy and rollback features without code changes.
- Implement robust error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar, Bugsnag).
- Use database backups with point-in-time recovery.
- Create runbooks for common maintenance tasks and emergencies.
- Set up automated health checks and simple alerting.
- Implement chaos engineering practices at a small scale to identify weaknesses.
- Have a documented incident response plan for production issues.

Readability for Long-term Maintenance
- Use consistent, descriptive method and variable names throughout the codebase.
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic, but avoid commenting obvious code.
- Document "why" not just "what" â€” explain the reasoning behind important decisions.
- Use design patterns consistently and document which patterns you're using.
- Create a style guide for your project and follow it rigorously.
- Use meaningful commit messages that explain purpose, not just actions.
- Maintain a changelog and architectural decision records (ADRs).
- Implement static code analysis tools (RuboCop, Brakeman, Rails Best Practices).

Maintainability Strategies for Solo Developers
- Ruthlessly limit dependencies to reduce update burdens.
- Regularly allocate time for dependency updates and security patches.
- Favor simple, proven technologies over cutting-edge options.
- Create a technical debt tracker and allocate regular time to address it.
- Automate repetitive tasks with scripts and custom rake tasks.
- Implement feature toggles to manage incomplete or experimental features.
- Document your system architecture with diagrams and keep them updated.
- Favor small, focused pull requests over large feature branches.
- Maintain a developer journal to document decisions and discoveries.
- Set up alerts for critical errors but filter noise to prevent alert fatigue.

Command Pattern Implementation with Simple Command
- Use the Simple Command gem (https://rubygems.org/gems/simple_command) as your primary command pattern implementation.
- Follow the gem's conventions: include SimpleCommand, define #initialize and #call methods.
- Leverage the success?, failure?, errors, and result interfaces provided by SimpleCommand.
- Create a standardized command structure (e.g., `MyCommand.call(params)`) with consistent interfaces.
- Design commands to either succeed completely or fail without side effects.
- Use errors.add(:field, :message) for consistent error handling in commands.
- Keep commands focused on a single operation rather than orchestrating multiple operations.
- Consider implementing command chains for complex workflows while maintaining single responsibility.
- Use dependency injection to make commands testable in isolation.
- Prefer explicit input parameters over implicit state.
- Document the purpose and expected outcome of each command clearly.
- Example command structure:
  ```ruby
  class CreateUser
    include SimpleCommand

    def initialize(user_params)
      @user_params = user_params
    end

    def call
      user = User.new(@user_params)

      if user.save
        return user
      else
        user.errors.full_messages.each do |error|
          errors.add(:user, error)
        end
        nil
      end
    end
  end

Usage in controllers:

```ruby
def create
  command = CreateUser.call(user_params)

  if command.success?
    render json: command.result, status: :created
  else
    render json: { errors: command.errors }, status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end
```
